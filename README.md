Download the zipfile and unzip

In the terminal navigate to the folder where you unzipped the file

go into the frontend folder then into the my-app folder

run "npm i axios"
run "npm i react"

go back to the main directory and run "npm run dev"

The application, backend server, and database should all be running now enjoy!

This application uses React as the frontend, Node.js in the backend, and mongoDB as the database.
